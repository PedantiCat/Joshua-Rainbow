This should be done gently. Too vigorous agitation will result in <strong>surge marks</strong>, while too little will result in <strong>bromide drag</strong>.</p>\n<p>I agitate for the first thirty seconds of development, then for the last 10 seconds of every subsequent minute, although this is not the only method. You may prefer something else, like continuous agitation. You may find rollers in one of the drawers for this, but I find the tanks tend to leak.</p>\n<p>You may invert the tank while agitating, but do not leave it inverted for more than a few seconds. </p>\n<p>You should tap the development tank gently on the wet bench to dislodge any air bubbles after each agitation, but be careful; the tanks are not indestructible, they will crack!</p>\n<h2 id=\"processing\"><a href=\"#processing\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Processing</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare a timer with your <strong>compensated development time</strong>.\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: The timing of the development time is critical.

Shorter times may result in purple negatives. Longer times may result in <strong>permanent</strong> stains.</li>\n<li>Pour your <strong>fixer</strong> from the measuring cylinder into the development tank, start your timer, then agitate as you did for the developer until the timer goes off again.</li>\n<li>Pour the <strong>fixer</strong> back into its measuring cylinder.</li>\n<li>Fill your development tank with water from the cold tap, then invert it 5 times and pour the water back out. Repeat this twice more, inverting 10 times then 20 times.</li>\n<li>At this stage you can open your development tank and inspect the sides of the film for edge markings and frame numbers to ensure it's developed. You likely won't be able to see images while the film is wrapped around the spiral, but don't remove it yet!</li>\n<li>\n<p>Put your film back in its development tank and leave it under a running tap for 5 more minutes.\nIn the meantime, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pour the <strong>fixer</strong> (will smell of vinegar) back into its bottle as it can be reused.</li>\n<li>Pour the <strong>developer</strong> (ID-11) back into its bottle as it can be reused.</li>\n<li><strong>Important:</strong> Please don't mix up the fixer and developer. If you do accidentally pour fix into developer or developer into fix, <a href=\"#contact\">contact a darkroom officer</a> <strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can reuse <strong>stop</strong> (which will normally be yellow) until it turns purple. Unless you're going to reuse it immediately, pour it down the drain.</li>\n<li>Rinse out the measuring cylinders you used and leave them to dry.</li>\n<li>Wipe down the wet bench with paper towels.</li>\n<li>Remove your gloves, and return your other PPE to where it belongs.</li>\n<li>Return any tools (scissors, bottle opener...) to their drawers.</li>\n<li>Put your scrap film/backing paper/film canisters in the bin.</li>\n<li><strong>Important:</strong> Mark down how many films you developed so the next person knows how much they need to compensate their development time!</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>\n<p>An optional addition is to run your film through a final bath of <em>Ilfotol Wetting Agent</em>. This isn't generally necessary in our darkroom as Sheffield's water is fine. It needs to be diluted 1+200 for use. There is a 15ml measuring cylinder somewhere in the darkroom that will help you measuring out these small volumes of concentrate.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Films</th>\n<th>Total Volume Required (ml)</th>\n<th><em>Ilfotol</em> (ml)</th>\n<th>Water (ml)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1x135*</td>\n<td>300</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>298.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1x120</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>2.5</td>\n<td>497.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2x135*</td>\n<td>600</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>597</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>\n<p>Hang up your film to dry, then: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>With clean hands, no more than three times, squeegee it between your index and ring finger.\n<strong>Important:</strong> I do not recommend using actual squeegees; a single bit of grit on one of these will leave a big scratch down the entire length of your film!</li>\n<li>Attach two pegs to the bottom of your film to weigh it down.

Isopropyl alcohol and a microfiber cloth works for me, but you can find countless other solutions online. Just be careful if the marks are on the emulsion (matt) side of the film as if you scratch this, you're scratching your image off the film! The glossy side is more robust but while there exist solutions to fix scratches on this side, it's best not to scratch it in the first place, so be gentle.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purple Negatives</strong>:\nThis can be caused by inadequate washing or under fixing. First try running the film under the tap for a further three minutes. If this doesn't work, try fixing and then washing the film again. If the film is still purple, please <a href=\"#contact\">contact a darkroom officer</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orange Negatives</strong>:\nYour film was supposed to be processed in C-41 chemistry.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Has Trails Of Lesser Density Trailing From The Sprocket Holes</strong>:\nThis is called bromide drag. It is caused by insufficient agitation during development.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Has Denser Areas Around/Trailing From The Sprocket Holes</strong>:\nIf they are uniform marks trailing from the sprocket holes in pairs, and you are left handed, they may be stress marks from winding the film back into its canister backwards. Otherwise, these are probably surge marks, generally caused by over agitation during development.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Is Entirely Dense (Black)</strong>:\nThis will happen in normal use to the leader of the film, as it will be exposed to light before the camera is loaded. If it occurs across the whole film, or in midsections, a severe light leak has occurred (perhaps by opening the camera back mid-roll). You might also have developed your film under an unsuitable safelight. Panchromatic films are generally not developed under a safelight.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Has Other Strange Dense Marks</strong>:\nThese may be light leaks. It may be possible to determine how the light leak happened by the geometry of the light leaks. For example, if it looks like the film has been marked with a shadow of itself it was likely fogged while it was being loaded into the development tank. If the light leaks are repetitive, align with frames, or emanate from the edges of the film (not the sprockets), it may be a light leak in your camera.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Is Greyish, But There Are Images</strong>:\nYour film was likely fogged, although some films have a high base+fog than others, so a grey base colour may be normal. This is typical with expired films.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Is Clear, But Has Edge Markings</strong>:\nThe edge markings are indicative of the fact that the film was developed properly. The film was simply not adequately exposed, if at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Is Clear And Has No Edge Markings</strong>:\nThis will usually occur if the film is fixed before it is developed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"storage\"><a href=\"#storage\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Storage</h2>\n<p>I recommend you store your negatives flat, as otherwise they will be difficult to scan and print from.</p>\n<p>The best solution is to get yourself some archival sheets.
