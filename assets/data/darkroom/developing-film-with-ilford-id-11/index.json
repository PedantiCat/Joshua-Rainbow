You can find this on the development time chart that should be mounted on the door of one of the cupboards. Find the time in the row for <em>ID-11 Stock</em>, in the column that corresponds to the film you have and the ISO you exposed it at.</p>\n<p>If you can't find your film on this chart, check the massive dev chart online.</p>\n<p>The massive dev chart: <a href=\"https://www.digitaltruth.com/devchart.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www.digitaltruth.com/devchart.php</a></p>\n<p>If you can't find it on the massive dev chart, contact the darkroom officer at shefuniphotosoc@gmail.com.</p>\n<p>You'll then need to find the large (5 litre) amber glass bottle of <em>Ilford ID-11</em>. It should have several labels on it. Each label should have up to five tally marks, and a compensation factor for the exhaustion of the developer (<code>N + %</code>). Find the current label (the one with the lowest % with less than five marks on it) and take note of its compensation value. </p>\n<p>You need to add this percentage of time onto your development time. You can simply convert your\ndevelopment time into seconds and use the following multipliers:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Compensation</th>\n<th>N+10%</th>\n<th>N+20%</th>\n<th>N+30%</th>\n<th>N+40%</th>\n<th>N+90%</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiplier</td>\n<td>1.1</td>\n<td>1.2</td>\n<td>1.3</td>\n<td>1.4</td>\n<td>1.9</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For example, <em>Ilford HP5</em> @ ISO 400 in <em>Stock ID-11</em> has a development time of <code>7 minutes and 30 seconds</code>. </p>\n<p>This is <code>7 * 60 + 30 = 450</code> seconds. If my compensation factor was <code>N+40%</code> I would multiply this by <code>1.4</code>, so my compensated development time would be <code>630</code> seconds (or <code>10 minutes 30 seconds</code>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"preparing-chemistry\"><a href=\"#preparing-chemistry\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Preparing Chemistry</h2>\n<p>Put your PPE on as appropriate (gloves, apron, goggles).</p>\n<p>You'll need a <strong>developer</strong>, a <strong>stop</strong>, and a <strong>fixer</strong>.

This should be done as gently as you would treat a small child; be gentle. Too vigorous agitation will result in <strong>surge marks</strong>, while too little will result in <strong>bromide drag</strong>.</p>\n<p>I agitate for the first thirty seconds of development, then for the last 10 seconds of every subsequent minute, although this is not the only method. You may prefer something else, like continuous agitation. You may find rollers in one of the drawers for this, but I find the tanks tend to leak.</p>\n<p>You may invert the tank while agitating, but do not leave it inverted for more than a few seconds as, again, the tank may leak. </p>\n<p>You should tap the development tank gently on the wet bench to dislodge any air bubbles after each agitation, but be gentle; the tanks are not indestructible, they will crack!</p>\n<h2 id=\"processing\"><a href=\"#processing\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Processing</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare your timer with your development time.\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: The timing of the development time is <strong>critical</strong>.

Shorter times may result in purple negatives. Longer times may result in <strong>permanent</strong> stains.</li>\n<li>Pour your fixer from the measuring cylinder into the development tank, start your timer, then agitate as you did for the developer.</li>\n<li>Pour the fixer back into its measuring cylinder.</li>\n<li>Fill your development tank with water from the cold tap, then invert it 5 times and pour the water back out. Repeat this twice more, inverting 10 times then 20 times.</li>\n<li>At this stage you can open your development tank and inspect the sides of the film for edge markings and frame numbers to ensure it's developed, but don't remove it from the spiral yet! </li>\n<li>\n<p>Put your film back in its development tank and leave it under running water under the tap for 5 more minutes.\nIn the meantime, you can:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pour the <strong>fixer</strong> (will smell of vinegar) back into its bottle as it can be reused.</li>\n<li>Pour the <strong>developer</strong> (ID-11) back into its bottle as it can be reused.</li>\n<li>You can reuse <strong>stop</strong> (which will normally be yellow) until it turns purple. Unless you're going to reuse it immediately, pour it down the drain.</li>\n<li>Rinse out the measuring cylinders you used and leave them to dry.</li>\n<li>Wipe down the wet bench with paper towels.</li>\n<li>Remove your gloves, and return your other PPE to where it belongs.</li>\n<li>Return any tools (scissors, bottle opener...) to their drawers.</li>\n<li>Put your scrap film/backing paper/film canisters in the bin.</li>\n<li><strong>Important:</strong> Mark off how many films you developed on the <strong>developer</strong> (ID-11) bottle's labels!</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>\n<p>An optional addition is to run your film through a final bath of <em>Ilfotol Wetting Agent</em>. This isn't generally necessary in our darkroom as Sheffield's water is fine. It needs to be diluted 1+200 for use. There is a 15ml measuring cylinder somewhere in the darkroom that will help you measuring out these small volumes of concentrate.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Films</th>\n<th>Total Volume Required (ml)</th>\n<th><em>Ilfotol</em> (ml)</th>\n<th>Water (ml)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1x135*</td>\n<td>300</td>\n<td>1.5</td>\n<td>298.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1x120</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>2.5</td>\n<td>497.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2x135*</td>\n<td>600</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>597</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>\n<p>Hang up your film to dry, then: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>With clean hands, no more than three times, squeegee it between your index and ring finger.\n<strong>Important:</strong> I do not recommend using actual squeegees; a single bit of grit on one of these will leave a big scratch down the entire length of your film!</li>\n<li>Attach two pegs to the bottom of your film to weigh it down. As it dries, it will warp and bend.

Isopropyl alcohol and a microfiber cloth works for me, but you can find countless other solutions online. Just be careful if the marks are on the emulsion (matt) side of the film as if you scratch this, you're scratching your image off the film! The glossy side is more robust but while there exist solutions to fix scratches on this side, it's best not to scratch it at all in the first place, so still be gentle.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purple Negatives</strong>:\nThis can be caused by inadequate washing or under fixing. First try running the film under the tap for a further three minutes. If this doesn't work, try fixing and then washing the film again. If the film is still purple, contact the darkroom officer at shefuniphotosoc@gmail.com.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Orange Negatives</strong>:\nYour film was supposed to be processed in C-41 chemistry.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Has Trails Of Lesser Density Trailing From The Sprocket Holes</strong>:\nThis is called bromide drag. It is caused by insufficient agitation during development.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Has Denser Areas Around/Trailing From The Sprocket Holes</strong>:\nThese are called surge marks. They are caused by over agitation during development.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Is Entirely Dense (Black)</strong>:\nThis will happen in normal use to the leader of the film, as it will be exposed to light before the camera is loaded. If it occurs across the whole film, or in midsections, a severe light leak has occurred (perhaps by opening the camera back mid-roll). You might also have developed your film under an unsuitable safelight. Panchromatic films are generally not developed under a safelight.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Has Strange Dense Marks</strong>:\nThese may be light leaks. It may be possible to determine how the light leak happened by the geometry of the light leaks. For example, if it looks like the film has been marked with a shadow of itself it was likely fogged while it was being loaded into the development tank. If the light leaks are repetitive, align with frames, or emanate from the edges of the film (not the sprockets), it may be a light leak in your camera.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Is Greyish, But There Are Images</strong>:\nYour film was likely fogged, although some films have a high base+fog than others, so a grey base colour may be normal. This is typical with expired films.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Is Clear, But Has Edge Markings</strong>:\nThe edge markings are indicative of the fact that the film was developed properly. The film was simply not adequately exposed, if at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Film Is Clear And Has No Edge Markings</strong>:\nThis will occur if the film is fixed before it is developed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"storage\"><a href=\"#storage\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Storage</h2>\n<p>I recommend you store your negatives flat, as otherwise they will be difficult to scan and print from.</p>\n<p>The best solution is to get yourself some archival sheets. They should be easy to find online.</p>\n"}},"context":{}}
